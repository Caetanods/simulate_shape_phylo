	## par = var covar matrix: dim equal to the number of coordinates. Recycle var and covar values. Each x,y par need to evolve at the same rate and with the same covariation in this model.
	## nsim = number of simulations
	## model = BM or speciational
	## tps = the procrustres coordinates for the shape of the root.

	## Known bugs: will break if nsim != 1.
	## Things to include: return the shapes at the nodes.
	## Things to expand: different rates for x and y coordinates (Ben's idea). Maybe elongated structures, for example, might evolves in different rates in one specific direction.
